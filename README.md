# MouselookHandlerVanilla

I started playing WoW with a trackball in 2019 due to RSI.  I was inspired by a
[video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIV_lH10xv4&t=164s).

This add-on implements a poor-man's version of
[MouselookHandler](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mouselookhandler) that
works with the original 1.12 Vanilla WoW client you might be using with private
servers.

## Usage

Create a macro with the text...

    /script MouselookHandlerVanilla.toggle()

...and bind it to whatever key you wish.

When mouselook is enabled via the addon, BUTTON2 (the right mouse button) is
set to toggle autorun.

This covers my use case.  YMMV.
